# Local Heroes API Guide

Welcome to the Local Heroes developer page. Our API allows affiliates to send leads directly to the Local Heroes platform. Our API uses GraphQL over HTTPS, and is secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

## Before integrating you should:

* Have a commercial agreement with us regarding the leads you will send
* Have an understanding of which taxonomies you are subscribed to
* Have a Partner ID
* Have a basic understanding of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [JWT](https://jwt.io/)

If you have any questions, please email apiteam@localheroes.com or speak to your Local Heroes account manager.

## Getting started
* [Create Keys](#create-keys)
* [JWT Structure](#jwt-structure)
* [Create Job API](#create-job-api)
* [Create Job API sandbox](#create-job-api-sandbox)
* [Response Codes](#response-codes)

#### Create keys
To authenticate against our API you will need to create a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed with your private key. To get started, please generate two pairs of public and private keys - one for sandbox and one for production. When you are ready, share your _public_ keys with us specifying which will be used for sandbox and which will be used for production.

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ./jwt.key
# Don't add passphrase!!
$ openssl rsa -in jwt.key -pubout -outform PEM -out jwt.key.pub
$ cat jwt.key
$ cat jwt.key.pub
```

If this doesn't work on your machine you might like to try using [Docker](./docker-keygen.md).

####  JWT Structure

To access our API you will need to create a JWT that you will pass as a bearer token in your HTTPS requests. The format of the JWT is: -

Header
```json
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

Payload
```json
{
  "iss": "partner",
  "lh:partner": "ID_PARTNER",
  "iat": 1516239022
}
```

If you are using nodeJS, you can use our [demo tool](./examples/node) to generate your JWT.

If you are using a different programming language then visit [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) for other library implementations.

#### URL

The URL for all API requests is the same.  The content of your POST request describes the action you want to take: -

`https://services.localheroes.com/graphql`


#### Check coverage

To check that we can cover a particular taxonomy item in a postcode use our `coverageByTaxonomy` query.

E.g. 
```graphql
query coverageByTaxonomy{
  coverageByTaxonomy(area:"sa99", taxonomyId:"lhrn:uk:taxonomy:affiliate/xxxx")
}
```

You need to use the authorization header, as described above.

HTTP Headers

- `Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN_HERE`

The response can be one of three values: -

* `true` - We do have coverage
* `false` - We do not have coverage
* An error condition reported in the error object. E.g. 'high demand'.  In exceptional circumstances we may report high demand for a particular speciality in a localized area.  If this happens we will not take on any more jobs, as the chances of finding a trader are low.  It is better that we let the customer know ASAP, so that they can look elsewhere.

#### Coverage sandbox

We recommend that you first try checking coverage using our API Sandbox.
We use the following special postcodes and taxonomies for coverage checking:

| TaxonomyId  | PostCode | Response |
| ------------| -------- | -------- |
| ---         | SA99 |  Error: High demand  |
| taxonomy/1  | ---  | true  |
| taxonomy/2<sup>*</sup> | --- | false |

<sup>*</sup> Or any other taxonomy apart from `taxonomy/1`

Here is an example of how to check coverage using the `curl` command: -

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxxx.xxxxx.xxxxx" -d '{ "query" : "query coverageByTaxonomy{ coverageByTaxonomy(area:\"sa99\", taxonomyId:\"lhrn:uk:taxonomy:affiliate/xxxx\")}" }
' "https://services.localheroes.com/graphql"

```

For simplicity I have placed the variables inline with the GraphQL query.  In practice it is better to separate out "query" and "variables" as separate properties in your JSON payload.

N.b. you need to replace xxxxx.xxxxx.xxxxx with your JWT created above.

We recommend using the [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground) tool for testing your GraphQL queries. 

#### Create Job API
To create a New Job you'll need to use a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) mutation.

```graphql
mutation {
  createJob(
    newJob: {
      job: {
        description: "DESCRIPTION FOR THE JOB"
        address: "CUSTOMER_ADDRESS"
        postCode: "SA99 1AA"
        jobType: STANDARD
        taxonomyId: "lhrn:uk:taxonomy:affiliate/xxx"
        timeSlot: {
          timeSlotStart: "2018-06-13T07:00:00Z"
          endTime: "2018-06-13T11:00:00Z"
          date: "2018-06-13T00:00:00Z"
        }
      }
      customer:{
        name: "CUSTOMER_NAME"
        mobile: "CUSTOMER_CONTACT"
        email: "customer@test.com"
      }
    }
  ){
    id
  }
}
```
HTTP Headers

- `Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN_HERE`
