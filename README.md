# Local Heroes API Guide

Welcome to the Local Heroes developer page. Our API allows affiliates to send leads directly to the Local Heroes platform.

## Before integrating you should:

-Have a commercial agreement with us regarding the leads you will send
-Have an understanding of which taxonomies you are subscribed to
-Have a Partner ID
-If you have any questions, please email apiteam@localheroes.com or speak to your Local Heroes account manager.

## Getting started
* [Create Keys](#create-keys)
* [JWT Structure](#jwt-structure)
* [Create Job API](#create-job-api)
* [Create Job API sandbox](#create-job-api-sandox)
* [Response Codes](#response-codes)

#### Create keys
To authenticate against our API you will need JSON Web Tokens (JWT) keys. To get started, please generate two pairs of public and private keys - one for sandbox and one for production. When you are ready, share your public keys with us specifying which will be used for sandbox and which will be used for production.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ./jwt.key
# Don't add passphrase!!
openssl rsa -in jwt.key -pubout -outform PEM -out jwt.key.pub
cat jwt.key
cat jwt.key.pub
```

####  JWT Structure

- Header
```json
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```
- Payload
```json
{
  "iss": "partner",
  "lh:partner": "ID_PARTNER",
  "iat": 1516239022
}
```

#### Create Job API
To create a New Job you'll need to use a graph ql mutation. We can recommend the use of GraphQL Playground.
```graphql
mutation {
  createJob(
    newJob: {
      job: {
        description: "DESCRIPTION FOR THE JOB"
        address: "CUSTOMER_ADDRESS"
        postCode: "SA99 1AA"
        partnerId: "ID_PARTNER"
        jobType: STANDARD
        ...
      }
      customer:{
        name: "CUSTOMER_NAME"
        mobile: "CUSTOMER_CONTACT"
        ...
      }
    }
  ){
    id
  }
}
```
- Header request
```json
    {
      "Authorization" : "Bearer JWT_TOKEN_HERE"
    }
```

We use the following Special postcodes for error triggering:

| PostCode  | Error |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| SA99 1AA  | Area not covered  |
| SA99 1AB  | Daily jobs creation limit reached  |
|SA99 1AC|	Request not authorized|

### Response Codes
